# Data movement between client and server
- Sending data from client side to server side in Node.js (Using fetch() api POST method). By using this method, you can send data in JSON format from client to server using `fetch()`.
- Sending data from server side to client side ejs, rendering the variable in ejs template ( `<%= variable name %>` ) and extracting that value in the client side js (still looking for better solutions for this, but this workaround works for now.
- Reading data from .json files on server using `fs`.
- Writing data to .json files on server using `fs`.
- Reading data from .json files to client using `fetch()`.


### How to run the project
- Make sure you have Node.js installed in your system.
- Run `git clone https://github.com/Swatilekha-Roy/Data-bartering-server-and-client-Node.js` on your command prompt.
Next, run these commands on your command prompt in the root of your project directory.
- `npm i`
- `node app.js` or `npm run dev` (Second one preferred, because it auto restarts your server).
- If it has run successfully so far, you'll have the server running on `localhost:3000`.
- Open `localhost:3000` on your favourite browser.
